[ Approved  by Governor  July\\xa016,\\xa02018. Filed with Secretary of State  July\\xa016,\\xa02018. ] LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST AB 2076, Rodriguez.\\n                          County employees’ retirement: disability: date of retirement. The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 provides a comprehensive set of benefits for county and district employees who are members of a retirement system subject to that law and establishes county retirement boards for the administration of benefits authorized under that law. That law authorizes a county retirement system in Los Angeles County to adjust retirement payments due to errors or omissions, as specified. That law also permits a member permanently incapacitated for duty to retire for disability only if specified criteria are met and requires the board to determine the effective date of retirement in those cases, as specified. This bill would authorize a county retirement system in Los Angeles County to correct a prior board decision determining the effective date of retirement for a member permanently incapacitated for disability that\\n\\t\\twas made between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015, and was based upon an error of law existing at the time of the decision, as specified. The bill would authorize a member seeking correction under these provisions to file an application with the board no later than one year from the date these provisions become operative. Digest Key Vote: MAJORITY  Appropriation: NO  Fiscal Committee: NO  Local Program: NO  Bill Text The people of the State of California do enact as follows: SECTION 1. Section 31541.1 is added to the Government Code, to read: 31541.1. (a)\\xa0Subject to subdivisions (c), (d), and (e) of Section 31541, the board, upon any terms it deems just, may correct prior board decisions made between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015, that were based upon an error of law existing at the time of the decision in the determination of the effective date of disability retirement pursuant to Section 31724. A member seeking correction of errors and omissions pursuant to this section may file an application for correction to the board no later than one year from the date this section becomes operative. (b)\\xa0This section shall apply to a county of the first class as described in Section 28020 and 28022.    \""
