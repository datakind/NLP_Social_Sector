## Text Classification

When a collection of texts comes with labels, it’s possible to train an algorithm to label new, un-labeled text. These labels might be, for example: the section of a newspaper that an article came from, whether an email was labeled as spam or not, or the topic of a bill.

Below, we explain how text classification works and apply it to finding health-related state bills.
