# Natural Language Processing in the Social Sector â€” Supplemental Materials

Supplemental materials to the article, *Six Ways to Implement Natural Language Processing in the Social Sector*. This repo contains the code supporting the [online demos](https://datakind.github.io/NLP_Social_Sector/) as well as sample code for reproducing the results. The intention behind sharing this material is to provide a starting point for further exploration of the techniques described in the article.

## Repository organization

- [`/docs`](/docs): Source code for demo site (https://datakind.github.io/NLP_Social_Sector/)
- [`/notebooks`](/notebooks): Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the results shown in the demo site
    - [`/notebooks/data`](/notebooks/data): input data for notebooks (NB: most data gets fetched from S3 from the notebook)
    - [`/notebooks/scrapers`](/notebooks/scrapers): sample code for scraping the input data
